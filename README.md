So I don't know what to say but that how to launch the Discord bot :

### Dependicies
`npm install && npm install dotenv@latest discord.js@latest fs@latest marked@latest`
> [!warning]
> Be sure that you've created a file named `.env` and you've written your Discord bot token after `TOKEN=` and remove `...`.

### Create the project (if it's the first launch)
`npm init`

### Launch
`node index.cjs`

and you're all right!
